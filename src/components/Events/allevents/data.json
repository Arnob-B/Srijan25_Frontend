Day 3 - The Final Verdict (23rd March 2025) Your solutions will come to life! Using live simulations in Universe Sandbox, the judges will verify your theories and evaluate how well your models align with astrophysical laws. Points will be awarded based on: Accuracy and scientific validity. Creativity and logical reasoning. Application of theoretical knowledge.
