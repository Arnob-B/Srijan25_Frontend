A team leader must provide the Codeforces account handle for each member during the registration for the contest, and the team formed should consist of the same accounts.\n\n  2. All teams must submit their own solutions for each problem. Any team found guilty of plagiarism will face disqualification.\n\n       3. There will be a 20-minute time penalty for each wrong submission. All three team members can make submissions for the problems in any order, but only the first correct submission for a problem will be considered.",
                "For Finals:-\n         1. Participants can only use the online IDE on Hackerrank platform, while solving the problems. Changing to another tab or window during the contest is strictly prohibited.\n2. Team members will be seated away from each other at their own desktops, and will not be able to directly communicate with each other during the contest (except for the bonus part in the last 30 mins). They can only view the code submissions made by the previous team member, for each problem. It is encouraged to leave comments in your code, so that you can share your approach/intended solution more effectively with the next team member.\n3. During the bonus part at the last 30 mins, team members will be seated together and will be assigned a single desktop. The team can communicate and solve the problems together during this part.\n4. There will be no time penalty for wrong submissions, and only the first correct submission for a problem, made by any of the three team members, will be considered."

Each of the three team members will be assigned a separate desktop. The duration of this contest will be 2 hours.\nFor the final round, the entire problem set will be divided into three parts and each team member will get exactly 30 minutes to work on each part, alternately. For example, in the first 30 minutes the three team members will be solving parts A, B and C respectively, in the next 30 minutes they will be solving parts C, A, B respectively, and so forth. Each part will consist of exactly 2 problems.\nAdditionally, a bonus part consisting of 1-2 problems will be available in the last 30 minutes, and unlike previous parts, all 3 teammates can communicate and work together for these problems.\nThus, three parts of 30 minutes each and one bonus part of 30 minutes for a total of 2 hours."
