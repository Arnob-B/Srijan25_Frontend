Each of the three team members will be assigned a separate desktop. The duration of this contest will be 2 hours.\nFor the final round, the entire problem set will be divided into three parts and each team member will get exactly 30 minutes to work on each part, alternately. For example, in the first 30 minutes the three team members will be solving parts A, B and C respectively, in the next 30 minutes they will be solving parts C, A, B respectively, and so forth. Each part will consist of exactly 2 problems.\nAdditionally, a bonus part consisting of 1-2 problems will be available in the last 30 minutes, and unlike previous parts, all 3 teammates can communicate and work together for these problems.\nThus, three parts of 30 minutes each and one bonus part of 30 minutes for a total of 2 hours.",

There will also be some theoretical questions for which points will be provided and they might serve as hints for the scenario. Participants will document their solutions on paper. Hints and supplementary modules will be provided, and participants are permitted to bring books. The use of phones, laptops, or internet access is strictly prohibited to maintain the integrity of the challenge. To further enhance their understanding, teams will be granted access to our Universe Sandbox simulator for a stipulated amount of time, allowing them to experiment with the mechanics of the simulator. The event will take place under the supervision of the organizing team, ensuring that guidance from the curated content and activity teams is available when needed. Day 3 - The Final Verdict (23rd March 2025) Your solutions will come to life! Using live simulations in Universe Sandbox, the judges will verify your theories and evaluate how well your models align with astrophysical laws. Points will be awarded based on: Accuracy and scientific validity. Creativity and logical reasoning. Application of theoretical knowledge. Mysterio is not just a test of knowledge but an opportunity to think like a scientist, applying theoretical insights to practical cosmic mysteries.
